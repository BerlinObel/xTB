Use of automated xTB scripts on steno

1. Prerequisites:
    Needs to be updated

2. Input file .csv:

    a. Column A, named ‘comp_name’, includes compound names, e.g. nbd_a1_b2_c3_d4

    b. Column B, named ‘smiles’, includes the corresponding SMILES string.

    c. Column C, named ‘charge’, includes the corresponding charge. Often just 0.

    d. Column D, named ‘multiplicity’ includes the corresponding multiplicity. Often just 1.

3. Get storage energies:

    a. Be in same folder as input file.

    b. Run: python submit_calculations.py $input_file.csv storage

    c. Promt will ask for batch size.

    d. Wait…

4. Get TBR barriers:

    a. Be in same folder as before.

    b. Make batch_list.csv by running: python prep_data.py tbr

    c. Run: python submit_calculations.py batch_list.csv tbr

    d. Wait…

5. Get max absorption wavelength and osc strength:

    a. Be in same folder as before.

    b. Make batch_batchlist_abs.csv with: python prep_data.py abs

    c. Run: python submit_calculations.py batch_list_abs.csv abs

    d. Wait…

7. Merge all the data into one csv:

    a. Be in same folder.

    c. Run: python prep_data.py final

    d. Data will be available in: final_results.csv

    e. Extract xyz structures by running: python get_xyz.py final_results.pkl
