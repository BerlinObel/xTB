Use of automated xTB scripts on steno

1. Prerequisites:

    a. Python 3.7 or larger with packages: pandas, rdkit, pickle, multiprocessing

    b. QMC Python package. Found at steno:/groups/kemi/elholm/opt/tQMC/QMC

2. Input file .csv:

    a. Column A, named ‘comp_name’, includes compound names, e.g. nbd_a1_b2_c3_d4

    b. Column B, named ‘smiles’, includes the corresponding SMILES string.

    c. Column C, named ‘charge’, includes the corresponding charge. Often just 0.

    d. Column D, named ‘multiplicity’ includes the corresponding multiplicity. Often just 1.

3. Get storage energies:

    a. Be in same folder as input file.

    b. Run: python control_conf_search_str.py $input_file.csv batchsize

    c. Wait…

4. Get TBR barriers:

    a. Be in same folder as before.

    b. Make batch_list.csv by running: python make_batchlist_tbr.py

    c. Run: python control_conf_search_tbr.py batch_list.csv

    d. Wait…

5. Get reactant absorptions:

    a. Be in same folder as before.

    b. Make batch_batchlist_abs.csv with: python make_batchlist_abs.py

    c. Run: python control_conf_search_abs.py batch_list_abs.csv

    d. Wait…

6. Get product absorptions:

    a. Be in same folder as before.

    b. Run: python control_conf_search_abs_prod.py batch_list_abs.csv

    c. Wait…

7. Merge all the data into one csv:

    a. Be in same folder.

    b. Make batch_list_final.csv: python make_batchlist_final.py

    c. Run: python merge_output_all.py

    d. Data will be available in: final_results.csv

    e. Extract xyz structures by running: python get_xyz.py final_results.pkl
